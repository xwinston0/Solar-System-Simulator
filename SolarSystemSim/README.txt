Project Report

Xiomara Winston & Mustafe Osman


Our project is a simulation utilizing two Python classes:
the Planet class and the Orbit class. The type of complexity
represented in our program involves rich and varied results.

The orbiting of Mercury, Venus, and Earth are to scale.


To run the simulation, you will need to utilize the function
called "run()" in MainSim.py, which holds all of the simulation code.
You will then click anywhere to start the simulation.
You will use the textbox at the top of the screen to
input one valid options: "q".

"q" will cause the program to close the graphics window.

The program will allow you to double click anywhere on the 
screen to aim the comet, and the comet will shoot in that direction.
Once the comet leaves the screen, the remaining planets will continue
to orbit around the sun until the user quits the program.


No bugs were observed in this project.
